## Project Overview

The CLionDemo project serves as an illustrative guide for developers to understand and leverage the features offered by CLion. Whether you are new to C/C++ or a seasoned developer, this project provides a solid foundation to explore the capabilities of CLion in enhancing your development workflow.

## Features

- Demonstrates basic and advanced C/C++ programming concepts
- Showcases CLion's powerful code navigation and refactoring tools
- Illustrates the use of CLion's debugging and profiling features
- Provides examples of integrating version control within CLion

## Installation

To get started with the CLionDemo project, follow these steps:

1. **Launch CLion**:
   - Open CLion from your applications or start menu.

2. **Get from Version Control**:
   - In the CLion welcome screen, click on `Get from VCS`.

3. **Repository URL**:
   - In the dialog that appears, paste the following URL:
     ```plaintext
     https://github.com/JetBrains/CLionDemo.git
     ```
   - Click `Clone`.

4. **Open the Project**:
   - Once the repository is cloned, CLion will automatically open the project.

## Using CLion

### Code Navigation

CLion offers powerful code navigation tools that make it easy to jump between different parts of your codebase. For instance:

- **Go to Definition**: Simply `Ctrl + Click` on Windows/Linux (`Cmd + Click` on macOS) on any function or variable to jump to its definition.
- **Find Usages**: Right-click on a symbol and select `Find Usages` to see where it is used throughout the codebase (or press `Alt + F7` on Windows/Linux, `Option + F7` on macOS).

### Refactoring

Refactoring code in CLion is straightforward and helps maintain a clean codebase. Some common refactoring options include:

- **Rename**: Select a symbol, right-click, and choose `Refactor` > `Rename` (or press `Shift + F6`).
- **Extract Function**: Select a block of code, right-click, and choose `Refactor` > `Extract` > `Function`.

### Debugging and Profiling

CLion's debugging and profiling tools are robust and user-friendly. Here are some key debugging shortcuts and their usage:

- **Start a Debug Session**: Use `Shift + F9` on Windows/Linux (`Cmd + D` on macOS) shortcut to start a debug session with the selected run/debug configuration.
- **Step Over**: Press `F8` to move to the next line in the current file without entering any function calls.
- **Step Into**: Press `F7` to enters the function call at the current execution point.
- **Step Out**: Use `Shift + F8` shortcut to step out of the current function and moves to the next line in the calling function.
- **Run to Cursor**: Use `Alt + F9` shortcut to run the program execution to the line where the cursor is placed.
- **Resume Program**: Press `F9` to resume the execution of the program until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
- **Evaluate Expression**: Use `Alt + F8` shortcut to open a dialog to evaluate an expression in the current context.

CLion also provides a CPU profiler to help identify performance bottlenecks:

- **Start CPU Profiler**:
   - Navigate to `Run` > `Profile '<target>'`.
   - This tool collects data on your program's execution to help you optimize its performance.

### Version Control Integration

CLion integrates seamlessly with Git and other version control systems. You can perform all version control operations directly within the IDE:

- **Commit Changes**: `Ctrl + K` on Windows/Linux (`Cmd + K` on macOS) to open the commit dialog.
- **Update Project**: `Ctrl + T` on Windows/Linux (`Cmd + T` on macOS) to pull the latest changes from the repository.
- **Push Changes**: `Ctrl + Shift + K` on Windows/Linux (`Cmd + Shift + K` on macOS) to push your local commits to the remote repository.
